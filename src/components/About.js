      </h2>
      <p style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', marginBottom: '1.2rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>
        Brand Snap is a free, student-built tool that helps you edit and optimize images online â€” no apps, no accounts, no stress.
      </p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', marginBottom: '1.2rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>
        Whether you're a student submitting assignments or a blogger posting content, large image files slow you down.
        Brand Snap solves that by letting you compress and resize images right in your browser.
      </p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', marginBottom: '1.2rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>
        We built this tool to be lightning fast, private, and super easy to use. Unlike many editing apps,
        Brand Snap doesn't watermark your photos or limit features behind a paywall. It's 100% free for everyone.
      </p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', marginBottom: '1.2rem', lineHeight: 1.7 }}>
        We're currently adding even more features like background removal and smart cropping powered by AI.
        This is just the beginning <span role="img" aria-label="rocket">ðŸš€</span>
